# Smart-Mirror-AI-Assistant

Smart technology has been in existence for some time now and has become an integral part of our lives, since 2008. The rise of voice-first smart devices has exploded since the release of smart phone personal assistants i.e. Siri [13], Google assistant [7] and Bixby [14]. Though these may have flaws, there is no arguing that with consistent development of these technologies they will prove to be a massive “step forward in the union between humans and computers” [1]. We are now in an age where we have IoT devices dedicated to listening and obey our every need, these devices include: Amazon Alexa [8] and Google Home [9]. 

What I aim for my Project is to create my concept of an IoT AI personal assistant in the form of a smart mirror. The normal smart mirror is an internet enabled device with a screen placed behind a one-way reflective surface. Running on the screen is a GUI based application which shows the user useful information from the internet. The one-way reflective mirror gives the device the basic functionality of a mirror and the internet enabled device gives the mirror the smart capabilities of your smart phone. This implementation of the smart mirror lacks two-way interaction between the mirror and the user. How my project differs from this is that it has a simple GUI which will not show the information, but the user will interact with my built-in voice-first personal assistant (like Alexa) to extract whatever information the user needs.
